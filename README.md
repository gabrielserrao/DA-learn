# DA-learn
This repository is dedicated to the exploration and understanding of different data assimilation methods using PyTorch, a powerful machine learning framework that enables automatic differentiation. Data assimilation is a mathematical discipline that uses observational data and a numerical model to improve estimates of the state of a physical system.
